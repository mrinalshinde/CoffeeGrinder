\noindent While the external manufacturing companies will be producing our products, we will attend to the marketing. One of the most effective and efficient marketing tactics to consider is a cross-marketing relationship with another brand. We could pair up with a fast food franchise. The franchise would use our coffee grinder and we could promote their brand by showing that it goes well with the coffee.

\noindent Setting up stalls in crowded malls is a good way of promoting a new product. Also, free coffee samples can be distributed and thus slowing customers down with free samples is a great way to introduce them to the product.

\noindent Every customer that checks the product is a marketing opportunity. This is because people talk, and people tend to trust friends and family more than they trust businesses. Influential bloggers in the area can start the buzz if shops give them an exceptional experience.

\noindent Take on small coffee shop accounts and grow with them.
