The potential market demand for the product was assessed and feasibility studies carried out. Attention to detail as per the potential market requirement was considered whilst implementing the development of the product. The project is scheduled to commence from April 2018, tested and launched by October 2018 before the onset of winter just in time to meet the high demand for hot beverages.
